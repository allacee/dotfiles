# dotfiles
This repo stores my dotfiles such as .vimrc .bashrc and more :)

### Thing to do in future:
  0. add description of setting everything up (like where to set $DOTFILES and things like this or what is vundle and how to set it up)
  1. get all aliases from bashrc to 'bash aliases'
  2. structurize and probably split vimrc to a few files
  3. add dotfiles from helios
  4. add guides to what my hotkeys does in vim
  5. To be continued...
