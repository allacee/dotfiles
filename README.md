# dotfiles
This repo was created to store and share my dotfiles setup.
There is also some hints to make your terminal experience better.

## Missing dots in the filenames
I've set $DOTFILES variable in my .profile and now on vim/bash startup files automatically loaded from the directory from $DOTFILES (for me it's ~/dotfiles) so I removed dot to make them visible be default



### Thing to do in future:
  0. add description of setting everything up (like where to set $DOTFILES and things like this or what is vundle and how to set it up)
  1. get all aliases from bashrc to 'bash aliases'
  2. structurize and probably split vimrc to a few files
  3. add dotfiles from helios
  4. add guides to what my hotkeys does in vim
  5. To be continued...
